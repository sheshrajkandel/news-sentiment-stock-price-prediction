Effect of news sentiment analysis for the effective stock price prediction on the banking sector of the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE)
Nature of the problem
Stock price prediction is an important task for a stock investor to make a wise and high profitable decision by determining the trend from historical stock data using a trained model. However, it is a challenging job to obtain an accurate prediction of a stock price due to the abstract and non-linear characteristics of the stock market. It is believed that historical stock data can be used for future price prediction. However, some argue and believe that prediction is not only dependent on historical data but also includes other factors.
Many researchers have suggested that incorporating financial news sentiment analysis could generate a better result than using just historical stock data for stock price forecasting. This study performs a comparative analysis of the results generated with and without incorporating news sentiment analysis. And this study carries out an assessment of whether incorporating the financial news sentiment analysis has any significance on the stock price prediction.
